            I currently work as an intern at Interpublic Group of Companies in their ESD department. 
            Once I am closer to graduating I'll be searching for full time job opportunities in the field. I have a decent amount of background knowledge in IS/T due to my near completion of my MIS degree, but I still have lots to learn.
